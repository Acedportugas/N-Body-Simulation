# N-Body-Simulation
N-Body Simulation uses python to solve for equations of motion for N-particles interacting gravitationally using Runga Kutta method to solve for the equations of motion. The result is visualized using 3D animation using matplotlib

# Usage

- Naviage to 'N-Body-Simulation.ipynb'
- You can veiw the code through github or Google colab. If viewed through gitub, the animated plot will not be working.
- For viewing through Google colab, click on the 'Google Colab icon' on top of the code. This will redirect you to the code in Google Colab.

# Bugs
- when running the code, if it shows 'KeyError: 'x_0' or similar, run the code again.
